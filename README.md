# Application-for-Detect-the-Diseases-that-happen-on-Plant

## Introduction
There is increasing difficulty in identifying new plant leaf diseases as a result of environmental change. There is a need to identify the factors influencing the emergence and the increasing incidences of these diseases. Here, we present emerging fungal plant leaf diseases and describe their environmental speciation. We considered the factors controlling for local adaptation associated with environmental speciation. We determined that the advent of emergent fungal leaf diseases is closely connected to environmental speciation. Fungal pathogens targeting the leaves may adversely affect the entire plant body. To mitigate the injury caused by these pathogens, it is necessary to be able to detect and identify them early in the infection process. In this way, their distribution, virulence, incidence, and severity could be attenuated.


## Who is the target of this problem:
The target is the farm owners who work to grow these plants and who suffer from those diseases that affect the leaves of the plants of uncle, such as tomatoes, potatoes, apples and other problems. Where those leaves are affected by rot that appears on the outer surface of the leaves.

## What is the proposed solution:
Here I made the perfect solution, which uses multiple techniques, one of the most important of these techniques is deep learning, where this application works entirely on the algorithms of neural networks, which work to classify these diseases in their normal cases, as these diseases are in cases such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and there are also those In a healthy condition. Here he works to reveal and clarify those cases. And with great accuracy.
