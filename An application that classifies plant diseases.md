# An application that classifies plant diseases
### Introduction

There is increasing difficulty in identifying new plant leaf diseases as a result of environmental change. 
There is a need to identify the factors influencing the emergence and the increasing incidences of these diseases. 
Here, we present emerging fungal plant leaf diseases and describe their environmental speciation. 
We considered the factors controlling for local adaptation associated with environmental speciation.
We determined that the advent of emergent fungal leaf diseases is closely connected to environmental speciation. Fungal pathogens targeting the leaves may adversely affect the entire plant body. To mitigate the injury caused by these pathogens, it is necessary to be able to detect and identify them early in the infection
process. In this way, their distribution, virulence, incidence, and severity could be attenuated.

## Provide the solution

Here, I am using deep learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to build a powerful model that is capable of classifying and detecting diseases that affect these plants. I also made an application that can work directly and be used to do so. It is built with flak and provides good results.

## Tools 
1. Deep learning
2. Flask
3. HTML & CSS
4. Python as language.
